# google_map_fl

This is my testing google_map ðŸ—º in flutter :)

- Reference [codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter/#0)

- **Note**: While it's technically possible to use the same Maps API key for both iOS and Android, it isn't recommended. Each platform has its own release cadence so each key should be unique.
